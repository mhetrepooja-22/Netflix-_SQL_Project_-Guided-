# üìä Netflix Data Analysis using PostgreSQL (Guided Project)

This project contains a series of SQL queries aimed at analyzing Netflix's content dataset to answer 15 real-world business questions. The queries explore various insights such as content type distribution, most common ratings, content trends over the years, genre analysis, and much more.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the Netflix content dataset using PostgreSQL. It includes writing SQL queries to answer specific business questions, working with string and date functions, aggregations, window functions, and conditional logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Functions and Techniques Used

This PostgreSQL project uses several built-in functions and techniques:

### ‚úÖ String Functions:
- `SPLIT_PART(text, delimiter, position)` ‚Äì extract parts of a string  
- `STRING_TO_ARRAY(text, delimiter)` ‚Äì split strings into arrays  
- `UNNEST(array)` ‚Äì convert arrays into rows  
- `ILIKE` ‚Äì case-insensitive matching  

### ‚úÖ Date & Time Functions:
- `TO_DATE(string, format)` ‚Äì convert text to date  
- `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)` ‚Äì extract year from a date  
- `CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 'x years'` ‚Äì calculate time difference  

### ‚úÖ Aggregation & Window Functions:
- `COUNT()`, `ROUND()`, `RANK()` ‚Äì summarize and rank data  
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` ‚Äì for grouping and filtering results  

### ‚úÖ Conditional Logic:
- `CASE WHEN` ‚Äì for creating custom categories (e.g., Good/Bad content)

## üìö What I Learned

Working through this project helped me strengthen my knowledge in:

- Writing **modular and optimized SQL queries** using CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Applying **text processing** to handle complex columns like `cast`, `genre`, and `duration`
- Using **window functions** to perform rankings within groups
- Performing **data filtering and transformation** using conditions and pattern matching
- Applying **date logic** to filter recent records
- Performing **trend and category analysis** using `GROUP BY` and aggregations
- Gaining insight into how platforms like Netflix can use SQL for **business decision-making**

### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```

**Objective:** Identify the most frequently occurring rating for each type of content.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM
(
    SELECT 
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) AS country,
        COUNT(*) AS total_content
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1
) AS t1
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Objective:** Identify the top 5 countries with the highest number of content items.

### 5. Identify the Longest Movie

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT DESC;
```

**Objective:** Find the movie with the longest duration.

### 6. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
```

**Objective:** Retrieve content added to Netflix in the last 5 years.
